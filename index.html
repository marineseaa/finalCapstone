    <!-- section about photography as a hobby -->
    <div class = "hobby">
        <p>
        My name is Marina. Photography has been my hobby for quite a long time. 
        It filled my life in a wonderful fulfilling way and helped me to discover and develop a creative side of me.
        Photography taught me to notice my world and to be aware of the wonderful little things that surround us each day.
        </p>
        <p>
        Photography can help you to capture anyting which is important for you.
        It's not only a memory, but it can bring you back to the feelings of that particular moment.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can take up photography as a hobby at any time, any age and with any camera. 
        In this blog I am going to share a lot of useful inforamtion and tips about photography.
