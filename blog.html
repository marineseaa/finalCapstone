        <h2>Macro photography equipment: extension tubes</h2>
        <p>Macro photography is a very popular area of photography. There are many things about it that make it an appealing genre. But many people believe you need an expensive macro lens to take macro photos.
            Fortunately, there are less expensive alternatives and extension tubes are one of them.
            With the right skills, you will be able to capture amazing images even without spending a ton of money for a dedicated macro lens.
            The images below were taken with a budget 50mm lens fitted with a 12mm extension tube.

        <h2>What are extension tubes</h2>
        <p>If you ever tried to do macro photography you might know about minimum focusing distance (MFD). It is the shortest distance at which a lens can focus. And it often becomes an issue in macro photography because your lens won’t focus close enough. Extension tubes help to solve this problem. <br>

            Macro extension tube, also called extension ring, is just a hollow cylinder that fits between your camera and lens, causing the lens to move farther from the sensor, and thus enabling your lens to focus more closely.<br>
            
            They come in different sizes from 8 to 35 mm and can be used
            in any combination or individually to get the magnification you want. You can also use it with any of your lenses, even with a dedicated macro lens. But note that they provide minimal magnification when used with telephoto lenses.<br>
            
            Most of the extension tubes have electronic contacts that allow you to use the autofocus feature and control aperture in-camera. Keep in mind that some extension tubes (usually cheaper ones) come without electrical contacts and they won’t have autofocus capability or aperture control.</p>
        <h2>What are the advantages of extension tubes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Low price. The extension tubes are at least 10 times cheaper than a dedicated macro lens.</li>
            <li>Can be used with any camera lens – even with existing macro lenses.</li>
            <li>It hasn’t any optical elements and that’s why there’s no loss in image quality.</li>
            <li>Provides predictable quality regardless of extension tube brand.</li>
            <li>Light-weight to add to your bag.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What are the disadvantages of extension tubes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Causes your lens to lose the ability of focusing on distant objects (unlike dedicated macro lenses which have a broad focus range).</li>
            <li>Increases the risk of dust particles settling on the camera sensor because you have to remove your lens from the camera every time you want to change the amount of extension or to focus on more distant objects.</li>
            <li>Light loss. Adding an extension tube increases the distance which the light has to travel to reach the sensor. That means your camera is needing to compensate for this with a higher ISO, or longer shutter. But you probably wouldn’t notice it if your camera is set to an automatic mode.</li>
